# CoinTrader
A big bounch of not working showcase code in an attempt to make a profitable automated cryptocurrency trading software with LSTM (long-short-term-memory) on a website http://cryptsy.com/, which sadly but ironically got robbed and shut down, hence the unworking project.

This attempt was continued in my next project "BTrader" by using https://www.bitstamp.net/
